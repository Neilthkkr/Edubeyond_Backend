1," A block of mass m is pulled across a rough horizontal table by a string connected to a motor that is attached to the floor. The string passes over a pulley with negligible friction that is vertically aligned with the left edge of the table as shown. The string and pulley both have negligible mass. The pulley is at height H above the table. The motor exerts a constant force of tension FT on the string, and the block remains in contact with the table at all times as the block slides across the table from x = L to x = 0. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the table and the block is μk. Express all algebraic answers in terms of m, H, FT, x, μk, L, and physical constants as appropriate.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQf08Y6D8L2HQzKq-zZ8sBmpRtsoTlZj/view?usp=share_link,,,,

1e,"Does the string do more, less, or the same amount of work on the block as the block moves from
x = L to x = \frac{L}{2} compared to when the block moves from x = \frac{L}{2} to x = 0?

Answers:
More work when the block moves from x = L to x = \frac{L}{2}
Less work when the block moves from x = L to x = \frac{L}{2}
The same amount of work when the block moves from x = L to x = \frac{L}{2}

2,"Cart 1 of mass m_1 is held at rest above the bottom of an incline. Cart 2 has mass m_2, where m_2 > m_1, and is at rest at the bottom of the incline. At time t = 0, Cart 1 is released and then travels down the incline and smoothly transitions to the horizontal section. The center of mass of Cart 1 moves a vertical distance of H, as shown. At time t_C, Cart 1 reaches the bottom of the incline and immediately collides with and sticks to Cart 2. After the collision, the two-cart system moves with constant speed v. Frictional and rotational effects are negligible.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjig3kMHKHpgHsccxTbU9bgR9UEvE8p9/view?usp=share_link,,,,

2e,"After the experiment, the students use a balance to measure the mass of Cart 2 and find it to be less than what was determined in part (d). To explain this discrepancy, one of the students proposes that the mass of Cart 1 was incorrectly measured at the beginning of the experiment. The students measure the mass of Cart 1 again and record a new value, m_1’.

Should the students expect that m_1’ will be greater than 0.250 kg, less than 0.250 kg, or equal to 0.250 kg?

Answers:
m_1’ > 0.250 \, \text{kg}
m_1’ < 0.250 \, \text{kg}
m_1’ = 0.250 \, \text{kg}

3,"A solid uniform disk is supported by a vertical stand. The disk is able to rotate with negligible friction about an axle that passes through the center of the disk. The mass and radius of the disk are given by M_d and R, respectively. The rotational inertia of the disk is
I_d = \frac{1}{2} M_d R^2.
A string of negligible mass is draped over the disk and attached to the top of the disk at point P. One end of the string is connected to an unstretched ideal spring of spring constant k, which is fixed to the ground as shown in Figure 1.

A block of mass m_B is then attached to the string on the right side of the disk. The block is slowly lowered until the spring-disk-block system reaches equilibrium, as shown in Figure 2. In this equilibrium position, the disk has rotated clockwise through a small angle \theta.

Give all algebraic answers in terms of M_d, R, k, \theta, and physical constants, as appropriate.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ht9bWDEBcv8W7kfCgi_NCjO4j_RDdTXp/view?usp=share_link,,,,
