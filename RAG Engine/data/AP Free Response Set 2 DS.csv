1,"A small sled slides across a rough horizontal table with an initial velocity v_0. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the sled and the table is \mu_k. A string connects the sled to a device on the ground. The device maintains constant tension F_T in the string by unwinding it as the sled slides to the right. The total mass of the sled is m. The string is attached to the device at x = 0 and at a height of y, as shown in Figure 1. The horizontal position of the sled is represented by x, as shown in Figure 2. Express all algebraic answers in terms of m, \mu_k, F_T, x, y, and physical constants, as appropriate.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXLvCJ80TF8m1165b0KMe2cTpQGCjw0Z/view?usp=share_link,,,,

2,"Block 1 of mass m_1 is held at rest while compressing an ideal spring an amount \Delta x. The spring constant of the spring is k. Block 2 has mass m_2, where m_2 < m_1. At time t = 0, Block 1 is released. At time t_C, the spring is no longer compressed and Block 1 immediately collides with and sticks to Block 2. The blocks stick together and the two-block system moves with constant speed v, as shown. Frictional effects are negligible.

2e,"After the experiment, the students use a balance to measure the mass of Block 2 and find it to be greater than what was determined in part (d). To explain this discrepancy, one of the students proposes that the spring constant was incorrectly measured at the beginning of the experiment. The students measure the spring constant again and record a new value, k’.

Should the students expect that k’ be greater than 150 N/m, less than 150 N/m, or equal to 150 N/m?

Answers:
k’ > 150 \, \text{N/m}
k’ < 150 \, \text{N/m}
