What AP \u00ae Stands For Thousands of Advanced Placement teachers have contributed to the principles articulated here. These principles are not new; they are, rather, a reminder of how AP already works in classrooms nationwide. The following principles are designed to ensure that teachers\u2019 expertise is respected, required course content is understood, and that students are academically challenged and free to make up their own minds. 1. AP \u0003 \u0003stands\u0003for\u0003clarity\u0003and\u0003transparency.\u0003Teachers\u0003and\u0003students\u0003deserve\u0003clear\u0003 expectations. The Advanced Placement Program makes public its course frameworks and sample assessments. Confusion about what is permitted in the classroom disrupts teachers and students as they navigate demanding work. 2. AP \u0003 \u0003is\u0003an\u0003unflinching\u0003encounter\u0003with\u0003evidence.\u0003AP\u0003courses\u0003enable\u0003students\u0003to\u0003develop\u0003 as independent thinkers and to draw their own conclusions. Evidence and the scientific\u0003method\u0003are\u0003the\u0003starting\u0003place\u0003for\u0003conversations\u0003in\u0003AP\u0003courses. 3. AP \u0003 \u0003opposes\u0003censorship.\u0003AP\u0003is\u0003animated\u0003by\u0003a\u0003deep\u0003respect\u0003for\u0003the\u0003intellectual\u0003 freedom of teachers and students alike. If a school bans required topics from their AP courses, the AP Program removes the AP designation from that course and its inclusion in the AP Course Ledger provided to colleges and universities. For example, the concepts of evolution are at the heart of college biology, and a course that neglects such concepts does not pass muster as AP Biology. 4. \u0003AP\u0003opposes\u0003indoctrination.\u0003AP\u0003students\u0003are\u0003expected\u0003to\u0003analyze\u0003different\u0003 perspectives from their own, and no points on an AP Exam are awarded for agreement\u0003with\u0003any\u0003specific\u0003viewpoint.\u0003AP\u0003students\u0003are\u0003not\u0003required\u0003to\u0003feel\u0003 certain ways about themselves or the course content. AP courses instead develop students\u2019 abilities to assess the credibility of sources, draw conclusions, and make up their own minds. As the AP English Literature course description states: \u201cAP students are", "and no points on an AP Exam are awarded for agreement\u0003with\u0003any\u0003specific\u0003viewpoint.\u0003AP\u0003students\u0003are\u0003not\u0003required\u0003to\u0003feel\u0003 certain ways about themselves or the course content.

AP courses ground such studies in primary sources so that students can evaluate experiences and evidence for themselves. 6. \u0003Every\u0003AP\u0003student\u0003who\u0003engages\u0003with\u0003evidence\u0003is\u0003listened\u0003to\u0003and\u0003respected.\u0003 Students are encouraged to evaluate arguments but not one another. AP classrooms respect diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. The perspectives and contributions of the full range of AP students are sought and considered. Respectful debate of ideas is cultivated and protected; personal attacks have no place in AP. 7. \u0003AP\u0003is\u0003a\u0003choice\u0003for\u0003parents\u0003and\u0003students.\u0003Parents\u0003and\u0003students\u0003freely\u0003choose\u0003to\u0003 enroll in AP courses.

The AP Program encourages educators to review these principles with parents and students so they know what to expect in an AP course. Advanced Placement is always a\u0003choice,\u0003and\u0003it\u0003should\u0003be\u0003an\u0003informed\u0003one.\u0003AP\u0003teachers\u0003should\u0003be\u0003given\u0003the\u0003confidence\u0003 and clarity that once parents have enrolled their child in an AP course, they have agreed to a classroom experience that embodies these principles. \u00a9 2024 The Advanced Placement Program, AP, AP Central, and the acorn logo are registered trademarks of the College Board.

Enrolling Students: Equity and Access The AP Program strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. The AP Program also believes that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved. Offering AP Courses: The AP Course Audit The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle that each school implements its own curriculum that will enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.

A syllabus or course outline, detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty. Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit. How the AP Program Is Developed The scope of content for an AP course and exam is derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and course\u0003offerings\u0003of\u0003colleges\u0003and\u0003universities.\u0003Using\u0003 this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam. The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty\u0003across\u0003the\u0003questions.\u0003 Committee members are selected to represent a variety of perspectives and institutions (public and private, small and large schools and colleges), and a range of gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups.", "and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty\u0003across\u0003the\u0003questions.\u0003 Committee members are selected to represent a variety of perspectives and institutions (public and private, small and large schools and colleges), and a range of gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject\u2019s current AP Test Development Committee members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org. Throughout AP course and exam development, College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide students\u0003with\u0003a\u0003college-level\u0003learning\u0003experience\u0003and\u0003 the\u0003opportunity\u0003to\u0003demonstrate\u0003their\u0003qualifications\u0003for\u0003 advanced placement or college credit. How AP Exams Are Scored The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiplechoice questions are scored by machine, the freeresponse questions\u0003and\u0003through-course\u0003performance\u0003 assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained, and their work is monitored throughout the Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of the\u0003scoring\u0003standards.\u0003Scores\u0003on\u0003the\u0003free-response\u0003 questions and performance assessments are weighted and\u0003combined\u0003with\u0003the\u0003results\u0003of\u0003the\u0003computer-scored\u0003 multiple-choice\u0003questions,\u0003and\u0003this\u0003raw\u0003score\u0003is\u0003 converted into a composite AP score on a 1\u20135 scale.

By confronting complex physical situations or scenarios, the course is designed to enable students to develop the ability to reason about physical phenomena using important science practices, such as explaining relationships, applying and justifying the use of mathematical routines, designing experiments, analyzing data, and making connections across multiple topics within the course. To foster this deeper level of learning, the AP Physics C:\u0003Mechanics\u0003course\u0003defines\u0003concepts,\u0003skills,\u0003and\u0003 understandings required by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit and/or placement. Students will practice reasoning skills used by physicists by discussing and debating, with peers, the physical phenomena investigated in class, as\u0003well\u0003as\u0003by\u0003designing\u0003and\u0003conducting\u0003inquiry-based\u0003 laboratory investigations to solve problems through first-hand\u0003observations,\u0003data\u0003collection,\u0003analysis,\u0003and\u0003 interpretation.

By studying kinematics, students will learn to represent motion\u2014both constant velocity and constant acceleration\u2014in words, in graphical (1.A and 1.B), and/or mathematical forms (2.A and 2.B), and from different frames of reference. Regular practice with these representations will help students analyze the specific motion of objects and systems while also dispelling some common misconceptions they may have about motion, such as exclusively using negative acceleration to describe an object slowing down. In addition, students will have the opportunity to think beyond their traditional understanding of mathematics. Instead of merely evaluating equations (2.B), students will need multiple opportunities to use mathematical representations to support their reasoning and gain proficiency in using mathematical", "exclusively using negative acceleration to describe an object slowing down. In addition, students will have the opportunity to think beyond their traditional understanding of mathematics. Instead of merely evaluating equations (2.B), students will need multiple opportunities to use mathematical representations to support their reasoning and gain proficiency in using mathematical models to describe physical phenomena. Preparing for the AP Exam Creating models and representations is a fundamental piece of the fourth question in the free-response section\u2014the Translation Between Representations (TBR), and the analysis of models and representations constitutes a large part of the multiple- choice section of the AP Physics C: Mechanics exam. Physicists often use models and representations to show the behavior of objects and/or systems of objects, and to illustrate physics concepts. Representations and models include, but are not limited to, sketches of the physical situation, graphs, mathematical equations, and verbal descriptions. As they encounter new scenarios through the unit, students should be encouraged to apply different representations based on the type of information given. Developing Understanding The world is made up of objects that are in a constant state of motion. To understand the relationships between objects, students must first understand movement. Unit 1 introduces students to the study of motion and serves as a foundation for all of AP Physics C: Mechanics by exploring the idea of acceleration and teaching students how representations can be used to model and analyze scientific information as it relates to the motion of objects. ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS \u00a7 How can the motion of objects be predicted and/or explained? \u00a7 How can the idea of frames of reference allow two people to tell the truth yet have conflicting reports? \u00a7 How can we use models to help us understand motion? \u00a7 Why is the general rule for stopping your car \u201cwhen you", "motion of objects be predicted and/or explained? \u00a7 How can the idea of frames of reference allow two people to tell the truth yet have conflicting reports? \u00a7 How can we use models to help us understand motion? \u00a7 Why is the general rule for stopping your car \u201cwhen you double your speed, you must give yourself four times as much distance to stop\u201d?

Those new expressions can help students compare physical quantities between scenarios (2.C), to make claims (3.B), and justify claims or predict values of variables using functional dependence (2.D). For example, students might be asked to determine the torque exerted on a system if the force exerted is doubled. Because using functional dependence to predict changes in quantities can be challenging, students may benefit\u0003from\u0003many\u0003opportunities\u0003to\u0003practice\u0003 these important mathematical skills that will be\u0003tested\u0003in\u0003both\u0003the\u0003multiple-choice\u0003and\u0003 free-response\u0003sections\u0003of\u0003the\u0003AP\u0003Physics\u0003C:\u0003 Mechanics Exam.

Similar to the approach used for translational energy and momentum concepts in Units 3 and 4, it is important that students have conceptual understanding of how angular momentum and rotational energy change due to external torque(s) on a system. Additionally, articulating the conditions under which the rotational energy and/or angular momentum of a system remains constant is foundational to working through more complex scenarios. Students will use the content and skills presented in both Units 5 and 6 to further study the motion of orbiting satellites and rolling without slipping in this unit. Building the Science Practices 2.C 2.D 3.B 3.C Unit 6 provides opportunities for students to compare physical quantities between scenarios\u0003or\u0003at\u0003different\u0003times\u0003in\u0003a\u0003single\u0003 scenario (2.C), as well as determine new values of quantities using functional dependencies between variables (2.D). From there, students can also make and justify claims based on these physical principles and functional relationships (3.B, 3.C). For example, students could describe conceptually what happens to the rotational inertia of a system when the pivot point is moved, and then justify what impact that change will have on the angular acceleration of the system. By the end of the unit, it is important for students to be comfortable with making claims about the reasonableness of their claims and\u0003justifications\u0003made\u0003with\u0003functional\u0003", "inertia of a system when the pivot point is moved, and then justify what impact that change will have on the angular acceleration of the system. By the end of the unit, it is important for students to be comfortable with making claims about the reasonableness of their claims and\u0003justifications\u0003made\u0003with\u0003functional\u0003 dependence (2.D, 3.C),\u0003starting\u0003with\u0003the\u0003first\u0003 principles of physics. Preparing for the AP Exam On\u0003both\u0003the\u0003multiple-choice\u0003and\u0003free- response sections of the AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam students need to be able to describe the relationships between physical quantities in order to articulate the\u0003effects\u0003of\u0003changing\u0003a\u0003physical\u0003quantity\u0003 in a scenario. Therefore, students will benefit\u0003from\u0003opportunities\u0003to\u0003investigate\u0003 changes in system, including practicing using fundamental principles of physics to decide whether a quantity will increase, decrease, or remain the same when another quantity is changed. In addition, when writing justifications\u0003for\u0003claims,\u0003simply\u0003referencing\u0003 an equation, law, or physical principle is not sufficient.\u0003For\u0003example,\u0003stating\u0003that\u0003one\u0003disk\u0003 is rolling faster than another because of \u201cconservation of energy\u201d is not a complete enough\u0003answer\u0003to\u0003earn\u0003credit\u0003on\u0003the\u0003free- response section of the AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam.

Consider the needs of the classroom when deciding what type of lab notebook to use. Lab Materials A wide range of equipment may be used in the physics laboratory, from generic lab items, such as metersticks, rubber balls, springs, string, metal spheres, calibrated mass sets, beakers, glass and cardboard tubes, electronic balances, stopwatches, clamps, and ring\u0003stands,\u0003to\u0003items\u0003more\u0003specific\u0003to\u0003physics,\u0003such\u0003 as tracks, carts, light bulbs, resistors, magnets, and batteries. Successful guided inquiry student work can be accomplished with simple, inexpensive materials and with more sophisticated physics equipment, such as air tracks, force sensors, and oscilloscopes.

Lab Time For AP Physics C: Mechanics to be comparable to a college physics course, it is critical that teachers make laboratory work an important part of their curriculum. An analysis of data from AP Physics examinees, regarding the length of time they spent per week in the laboratory, shows that increased laboratory time correlates with higher AP scores. Flexible or modular scheduling must be implemented to meet the\u0003time\u0003requirements\u0003identified\u0003in\u0003the\u0003course\u0003outline.\u0003 Furthermore, it is important that the AP Physics laboratory program be adapted to local conditions and\u0003funding\u0003as\u0003it\u0003aims\u0003to\u0003offer\u0003the\u0003students\u0003a\u0003well- rounded experience with experimental physics.

The AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam directly assesses the learning objectives of the course framework, which means that the inclusion of appropriate experiments aligned with those learning objectives is important for student success. Teachers should select experiments that provide students with the broadest laboratory experience possible. We encourage teachers to be creative in designing their lab program while ensuring that students explore and develop an understanding of the core techniques of writing experimental procedures and\u0003analyzing\u0003data.\u0003After\u0003completion,\u0003students\u0003should\u0003 be able to describe how to construct knowledge, model (create an abstract representation of a real system),\u0003design\u0003experiments,\u0003analyze\u0003visual\u0003data,\u0003and\u0003 communicate physics.

Many questions on the AP Exam are written in an experimental context, so these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance. Because AP Physics C: Mechanics is equivalent to a college course, the equipment and time allotted to laboratories should be similar to that in a college course. Therefore, schools must ensure that students\u0003have\u0003access\u0003to\u0003scientific\u0003equipment\u0003and\u0003all\u0003 materials\u0003necessary\u0003to conduct\u0003hands-on,\u0003college-level\u0003 physics\u0003laboratory investigations.

In addition, a general set of safety guidelines should be set forth for students at the beginning of the course. The following is a list of possible general guidelines teachers may post.

Return to Table of Contents \u00a9 2024 College Board Laboratory Investigations V.1 | 141 AP Physics C: Mechanics Course and Exam Description Laboratory Investigations Introduction Laboratory investigations, experiments, and activities (also called \u201clabs\u201d) are the cornerstone of many successful physics classrooms. Labs give students the opportunity to investigate behaviors of objects and systems, make observations, and develop their own explanations and understandings of the physical world. Within labs, students explore patterns and systems to make conclusions that can be used to predict future outcomes. This cycle of observation, measurement,\u0003recording,\u0003analyzing,\u0003and\u0003concluding\u0003 is the backbone of all science. Justifying conclusions by applying the knowledge, concepts, and principles that are discussed in lecture or classwork sessions to tangible material connects physical actions to conceptual understanding. Labs provide students with additional ways to encode information, which increases the methods by which they are able to retrieve and apply that information. An analysis of data from AP Physics examinees, regarding the length of time they spent per week in the laboratory, shows that increased lab time correlates with higher AP Exam scores. Descriptions of Labs AP Physics courses require that 25% of instruction time\u0003is\u0003spent\u0003in\u0003hands-on\u0003laboratory\u0003work.\u0003In\u0003practice,\u0003 this translates to approximately one classroom period of 45 minutes per week (for a course that meets 5 days a week for 45 minutes for the entire school year) that is\u0003devoted\u0003to\u0003lab-related\u0003activities.\u0003This\u0003average\u0003can\u0003 be implemented in a variety of", "scores.

Some teachers do labs on the same day every week, using a weekly cycle\u0003of\u0003content,\u0003practice,\u0003application,\u0003and\u0003low-stakes\u0003 formative assessment. Others prefer to do one \u201cbig\u201d or more complex lab every two weeks. Some teachers prefer\u0003to\u0003thread\u0003quick\u000320-minute\u0003\u201cmini\u0003labs\u201d\u0003throughout\u0003 their daily classroom routines. Some teachers plan a few investigative labs at the start of a unit; then spend\u0003significant\u0003class\u0003time\u0003on\u0003practice,\u0003discussion,\u0003 and application of concepts; and then end the unit with one or two more complex labs that incorporate content from the entire unit. And even further still, some teachers do a combination of all of the above. Any approach is acceptable as long as the 25% requirement is met. Defining \u201cLabs\u201d and \u201cLab Time\u201d Perhaps the most common questions asked by teachers who are planning their lessons are variations of: Bullet \u201cWhat counts as a lab?\u201d Bullet \u201cWhat counts as time spent on labs?\u201d Bullet \u201cDo labs need to take the entire class period?\u201d Bullet \u201cDo students need to be in the \u2018lab\u2019 part of the classroom to count as lab time?\u201d Bullet \u201cDo digital or online lab simulations count for lab time?\u201d Bullet \u201cDo\u0003labs\u0003need\u0003to\u0003have\u0003formal\u0003write-ups?\u201d\u0003 Labs For AP Physics, a lab is performed any time data is collected\u0003and/or\u0003analyzed.\u0003A\u0003follow-up\u0003question\u0003might\u0003 then be: \u201cWhat is the threshold for collecting data?\u201d For AP Physics, data is collected any time a student writes down an observation or measurement. Data can be qualitative, such as \u201cThe hockey puck looks like it slows down,\u201d or quantitative \u201cThe acceleration of the hockey puck was negat iv e 1.23 meter per second squared. .\u201d Data can be", "AP Physics, data is collected any time a student writes down an observation or measurement.

For example, a lab may pose the question: \u201cWhat is the relationship between the impulse given to an object and that object\u2019s change in momentum?\u201d Prior to this lab,\u0003teachers\u0003will\u0003have\u0003given\u0003definitions\u0003of\u0003impulse\u0003 and momentum, but may not have discussed the Impulse\u2013Momentum Theorem. Students will determine what data to record, how to obtain that data, take measurements, and then make a conclusion about the relationship between the impulse given to an object and that object\u2019s change in momentum. The purpose of investigation labs is to have students create their own understanding of the behavior of a physical system. When created on its own, this understanding may provide a much more solid foundation on which the student can build further knowledge than when that same student is simply told about a physics concept. A real, tangible, physical experience is often much easier to relate to and remember. The phrase \u201cRemember when you did \u2026\u201d can be much more accessible than \u201cImagine you will \u2026\u201d Note that if students already know the relationship between impulse and the change in momentum, an investigation\u0003lab\u0003is\u0003easily\u0003turned\u0003into\u0003a\u0003verification\u0003lab. Verification labs\u0003confirm\u0003information\u0003students\u0003have\u0003 already been provided.

An application lab is when students are asked to apply a known physical principle or idea to a lab setup in order\u0003to\u0003find\u0003a\u0003specific\u0003answer\u0003or\u0003quantity.\u0003For\u0003example,\u0003 a lab may", "the approach of\u0003the\u0003teacher,\u0003these\u0003labs\u0003can\u0003also\u0003be\u0003beneficial\u0003and\u0003 useful\u0003in\u0003the\u0003classroom.\u0003However,\u0003the\u0003power\u0003of\u0003self- discovery should be harnessed as often as possible, as it frequently helps students make their learning more permanent\u0003than\u0003when\u0003they\u0003simply\u0003confirm\u0003the\u0003answer\u0003 found by others.

The results in application labs are typically easy to assess as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d If students experimentally determine that the mass of the cart is 350g, place the cart on a scale, and measure the mass of the cart to be 347g, that provides instant feedback on how well the students applied physics, laboratory skills, and the quality of their measurements.\u0003A\u0003lab\u0003group\u0003that\u0003obtains\u0003682g\u0003for\u0003the\u0003 same cart has similar instant feedback.

Multiple photogates can be set up to precisely measure the time an object takes to pass from one gate to the next. Due to how photogates work, a single photogate cannot measure the direction of an object\u2019s motion. \u25c6 Note that while the data photogates measure can be used to calculate speed, the quantity that photogates are directly measuring is time. \u25c6 Photogates can be said to determine speed, but\u0003depending\u0003on\u0003the\u0003configuration\u0003of\u0003the\u0003 photogates, the speed being measured may be considered to be equal to the object\u2019s instantaneous speed at that single location, or\u0003the\u0003average\u0003speed\u0003between\u0003two\u0003different\u0003 photogates. In some applications, this distinction is crucial to obtaining the appropriate value. \u00a7 Spring scales/Force sensors \u25c6 Spring scales use the calibrated compression or extension of a spring to determine the force exerted on the spring. \u25c6 Electronic force sensors typically use a metal gauge that is deformed by a force exerted on the gauge. Electronic force sensors tend to have much more precision and accuracy than spring scales. \u25c6 Note that spring scales are a direct application of Hooke\u2019s law in the lab, and that while the discussion of how electronic force sensors may be fascinating to some students, knowing the\u0003specifics\u0003of\u0003exactly\u0003how\u0003and\u0003why\u0003they\u0003work\u0003 is not required for the exam. \u00a7 Low-friction/low\u0003inertia\u0003pulleys \u25c6 These\u0003are\u0003pulleys\u0003that\u0003have\u0003very\u0003low-friction\u0003 axles and low rotational inertia, which allows the pulleys to be used without needing to account for friction or the", "the lab, and that while the discussion of how electronic force sensors may be fascinating to some students, knowing the\u0003specifics\u0003of\u0003exactly\u0003how\u0003and\u0003why\u0003they\u0003work\u0003 is not required for the exam. \u00a7 Low-friction/low\u0003inertia\u0003pulleys \u25c6 These\u0003are\u0003pulleys\u0003that\u0003have\u0003very\u0003low-friction\u0003 axles and low rotational inertia, which allows the pulleys to be used without needing to account for friction or the rotation of the pulley in the experimental setup.

Cell phones have stopwatches, video cameras (and\u0003most\u0003with\u0003slow-motion\u0003or\u0003even\u0003time- lapse capabilities), accelerometers that can be used to measure angles and acceleration, magnetometers, microphones, GPS, and so on. In addition, there are many free apps that students can download that take advantage of these sensors within a physics lab setting. Cell phones can be used if available but are not required. For most laboratory investigations where data collection with phones is desired, one\u0003phone\u0003per\u0003group\u0003will\u0003suffice.\u0003 \u00a7 Video analysis/Computer software \u25c6 There are multiple options for computer software and video analysis of varying cost and functionality. Electronic sensors should come with the software needed to operate those sensors. More robust software can use collected data to measure the area under a curve,\u0003or\u0003perform\u0003curve-fitting\u0003analyses\u0003or\u0003 linear regressions, and more.

Strategy Description Example Ask the Expert Students are assigned as \u201cexperts\u201d on concepts they understand well; groups rotate", "them to apply their understanding of course concepts. Teachers may consider the following strategies as they plan instruction. Please note they are listed alphabetically and not by order of importance or instruction. Strategy Description Example Ask the Expert Students are assigned as \u201cexperts\u201d on concepts they understand well; groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about concepts they need to work on, providing students with opportunities to share knowledge and learn from one another. Assign student \u201cexperts\u201d on conservation of linear momentum questions. Have students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to justify a set of claims pertaining to each question with corresponding physical laws. \u201cExperts\u201d can be swapped at any point during the rotation so that all students have the opportunity to lead work and engage with multiple problems. Changing Representations Students translate from one representation (e.g., motion map) to\u0003another\u0003(e.g.,\u0003a\u0003free-body\u0003 diagram). This may involve creating pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data. For a given situation involving energy conservation, have students create a sketch of\u0003the\u0003identified\u0003system,\u0003a\u0003set\u0003of\u0003conservation\u0003 of energy equations, sets of energy bar charts and graphs of potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy; or combinations of the above representations.

Some examples\u0003may\u0003include:\u0003analyzing\u0003the\u0003forces\u0003and\u0003 then using kinematics, using conservation of energy\u0003on\u0003the\u0003object-Earth\u0003system,\u0003using\u0003the\u0003 impulse-momentum\u0003theorum,\u0003and\u0003using\u0003angular\u0003 impulse and angular momentum. Friends Without Pens Students solve problems by engaging in two \u201crounds\u201d of timed\u0003work\u2014in\u0003groups\u0003and\u0003then\u0003 independently.\u0003In\u0003the\u0003first\u0003round,\u0003 called \u201cfriends without pens,\u201d, students are grouped together to discuss the problem but are not permitted to write anything. In the second round, called \u201cpens without friends,\u201d students return to their desk where they complete and\u0003finalize\u0003their\u0003responses\u0003to\u0003the\u0003 problem individually, using any information they remember from their group discussion and their own knowledge of course concepts. Ask students to evaluate two scenarios where blocks sit at rest on a tabletop where friction between the table and the block is negligible. In one scenario, the block is pulled by a string where the tension in the string is 50 N. In the second scenario an identical string is attached to the block, travels over a pulley and is attached to an object of mass 5 kg. Ask students to compare the accelerations of the blocks in the two scenarios by making a claim about the accelerations and providing evidence to", "In the second scenario an identical string is attached to the block, travels over a pulley and is attached to an object of mass 5 kg. Ask students to compare the accelerations of the blocks in the two scenarios by making a claim about the accelerations and providing evidence to support that claim. Four-Square Problem Solving Students are given a scenario, perhaps one that came from a\u0003traditional,\u0003\u201cplug-and-chug\u201d\u0003 calculation problem. They divide a sheet of paper into four quadrants. In each quadrant, students put some representation of what is going on in the problem (e.g., motion maps or graphs, free-body\u0003diagrams,\u0003energy\u0003 bar graphs, momentum bar graphs, mathematical models (i.e., equations with symbols), well-labeled\u0003diagrams,\u0003or\u0003written\u0003 explanation (i.e., two to three strong, clear sentences). Assign students the scenario of a disk rolling without\u0003slipping\u0003down\u0003an\u0003incline.\u0003For\u0003the\u0003four- squares, have students A. sketch a force diagram of the disk. B. sketch an energy bar chart of the translational kinetic, rotational kinetic, and gravitational potential energy of the disk\u2013Earth system when the disk is at the top and bottom of the incline. C. derive an equation for the translational speed of the disk at the bottom of the incline. D. make\u0003a\u0003claim\u0003about\u0003the\u0003final\u0003speed\u0003of\u0003a\u0003hoop\u0003 (with the same mass and radius) if it were released from rest at the top of the same incline. Graph and Switch Each student in a pair generates a graph (or sketch of a graph), on a graphing calculator or on paper, to model a certain function. Then, the students switch graphing calculators or papers to review each other\u2019s solutions. As students learn about momentum diagrams, have them graph momentum versus time and force versus time, as well as create a momentum diagram to model a single situation. Have students individually graph and explain how their representations support a claim they make about the situation.

Leave time for students to ask clarifying questions about words\u0003or\u0003phrases\u0003they\u0003find\u0003unclear\u0003before\u0003asking\u0003 them to provide a solution. Meaningful, Meaningless Calculations Students decide whether a calculation is meaningful (i.e., it gives a value that tells us something legitimate about the physical situation) or is meaningless (i.e., the expression is a totally inappropriate use of a relation). For example, a meaningless calculation might involve substituting a wrong numerical value into an expression. Ask students to write an expression for the energy of a system. Have them decide which of the following expressions are meaningful, based on the units for the involved quantities: MgD, Mg/D, MD/g and 1/MgD. Have students explain why the other expressions are meaningless, and address and discuss any misconceptions that arise. Ask students about a situation where a cart with a fan\u0003is\u0003released\u0003from\u0003rest\u0003and\u0003moves\u0003across\u0003a\u0003flat\u0003 tabletop 1 m long with negligible friction.

Then, ask students if and why this is a meaningful calculation for this situation and why other calculations are inappropriate or meaningless. Note Taking Students create a record of information while reading a text, listening to a speaker, or interacting with a problem. Have students write down descriptions of the steps needed to solve a problem, in words, so that a record of the processes can be referred to at a later point in time. Predict and Explain Students predict what will happen in\u0003a\u0003situation\u2014one\u0003they\u0003are\u0003 familiar\u0003with\u0003or\u0003have\u0003sufficient\u0003 background\u0003information\u0003about\u2014 and explain why they think that outcome will occur. When a ballistic pendulum is set up, ask students what will happen to the maximum swing height when the mass of the dart is increased or decreased. Then, ask students the following questions: What would happen if the dart were to\u0003bounce\u0003off\u0003of,\u0003instead\u0003of\u0003stick\u0003into\u0003the\u0003block?\u0003 What if the dart passed through the block? Qualitative Reasoning Students are presented with an initial\u0003and\u0003a\u0003final\u0003version\u0003of\u0003the\u0003 same physical situation and asked to apply a principle to qualitatively reason how some quantity, or aspect, will change. Ask students what would happen to the angular momentum of an object in orbit around the Earth if the radius of orbit were increased, if the speed of orbit were decreased, or if the mass of the Earth were changed. To continue their thinking, you may ask students: What happens to the energy of the system as the physical properties above are changed?", "orbit around the Earth if the radius of orbit were increased, if the speed of orbit were decreased, or if the mass of the Earth were changed.

Ranking Tasks Students are presented with a series of variations of a situation, based\u0003on\u0003a\u0003specific\u0003scenario.\u0003 The\u0003variations\u0003differ\u0003in\u0003the\u0003 values (numeric or symbolic) for the variables involved, but also frequently include variables that are not important to the task. Students rank the variations of a specified\u0003physical\u0003quantity\u0003and\u0003 must also explain the reasoning for their ranking choices, as well as\u0003rate\u0003their\u0003confidence\u0003in\u0003their\u0003 ranking.

Sharing and Responding Students communicate with each other in pairs or in groups, taking turns proposing a solution to a problem and responding to the solutions of others. Have students individually answer a released free-response\u0003question\u0003from\u0003the\u0003AP\u0003Physics\u0003C:\u0003 Mechanics Exam.

To make a good model, students need to identify a set of the most important characteristics of a phenomenon or system that may simplify analysis. They then need to create a representation of those characteristics. Examples of representations used to model introductory physics concepts are pictures, motion\u0003maps,\u0003free-body\u0003diagrams,\u0003force\u0003diagrams,\u0003 graphs, energy bar charts, and momentum charts.

On the AP Physics exams, individual forces represented on a free-body diagram must be drawn as individual straight arrows, originating on the dot and pointing in the direction of the force. Individual forces that are exerted in the same direction must be drawn side by side, not overlapping. Students often think that to make a graph, they need to connect\u0003the\u0003data\u0003points,\u0003or\u0003that\u0003the\u0003best-fit\u0003function\u0003is\u0003 always linear.

Physicists commonly use mathematical representations to describe and explain phenomena, as well as to solve problems. When students work with these representations, they should understand the connections between the mathematical descriptions, the physical phenomena, and the concepts represented in them. When using equations or mathematical representations, students need to be able to justify why using a particular equation or mathematical representation\u0003to\u0003analyze\u0003a\u0003situation\u0003is\u0003useful,\u0003and\u0003be\u0003 aware of the conditions under which the equation/ mathematical representation can be used.

Science Practice 3: Scientific Questioning and Argumentation Describe experimental procedures, analyze data, and support claims. Physicists examine data and evidence to develop claims about physical phenomena. As they articulate their claims, physicists use reasoning processes that\u0003rely\u0003on\u0003their\u0003awareness\u0003of\u0003different\u0003types\u0003of\u0003 relationships, connections, and patterns within the data and evidence.

One step may be designing a second experiment to determine the same quantity and then checking for consistency across the two measurements. Finally, students should be able to revise their initial explanation or reasoning based on the new data. The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for students in AP Physics C: Mechanics. Analysis skills can be taught using any type of data, but students will be more invested in their data analysis if it is data they have collected through their own investigations.

The model sets out the boundaries within which the scientist will consider that phenomenon. Typically, these boundaries simplify a complex scenario to make the analysis and description of that scenario easier and more accessible, particularly to students just beginning their studies in physics. Consider perhaps the most common example of an introductory physics problem: \u201cA block is at rest at the top of an inclined plane. Determine the speed of a block at the bottom of the inclined plane.\u201d What should students consider in their calculations? What model of the block/incline/earth should students use to describe this situation? To describe the subtleties of the scenario, students would need to consider friction and air\u0003resistance;\u0003the\u0003slight\u0003increase\u0003in\u0003gravitational\u0003field\u0003 as the block slides downward; and the loss of energy to vibrations, sound, and thermal energy. Does the coefficient\u0003of\u0003friction\u0003decrease\u0003slightly\u0003as\u0003the\u0003abrasion\u0003 between the block and incline subtly smooths the surfaces? Should the density, temperature, and relative humidity of the air be considered?

The surfaces of the blocks matter when it comes to describing their interactions. However, the blocks may still be treated as objects because the force of friction exerted on one block by the other block does not depend\u0003on\u0003the\u0003size\u0003or\u0003shape\u0003of\u0003the\u0003blocks.\u0003The\u0003amount\u0003 of area of the blocks that are in contact with each other does not change the force of friction, and so the blocks may still be modeled as objects. The object model is used throughout AP Physics C: Mechanics to simplify the analysis of most phenomena. An \u201cobject\u201d can be anything because what the object is is not important to the analysis.

In this case, it is up to the student to create their own mental representation of the situation. Systems A COLLECTION OF OBJECTS THAT ARE ANALYZED TOGETHER. A system is how a physicist chooses to group objects together\u0003to\u0003analyze\u0003a\u0003given\u0003scenario.\u0003As\u0003students\u0003gain\u0003 a deeper understanding of physics concepts, they will notice\u0003that\u0003how\u0003systems\u0003are\u0003chosen\u0003can\u0003significantly\u0003 simplify\u0003(or\u0003significantly\u0003complicate)\u0003the\u0003analysis\u0003of\u0003a\u0003 problem. There is no single right or wrong way to group objects, but often the preferred method is to choose a system\u0003that\u0003simplifies\u0003the\u0003analysis. Note that in special cases, a system can itself be reduced to a single object. This can happen when the behaviors and interactions of the individual parts of the\u0003system\u0003do\u0003not\u0003affect\u0003the\u0003behavior\u0003or\u0003analysis\u0003of\u0003 the system as a whole. Consider a box of cereal. In reality, this is a very complex system. A cardboard box, a plastic bag, and a large number of pieces of cereal within. However, the complex motion of the pieces of cereal within the box are not important to consider", "the system as a whole. Consider a box of cereal. In reality, this is a very complex system. A cardboard box, a plastic bag, and a large number of pieces of cereal within. However, the complex motion of the pieces of cereal within the box are not important to consider when handling the box of cereal. Therefore, the entire box\u2013bag\u2013cereal system can itself be considered as a single object. Unless the system is chosen to be the entire observable universe (which would require an exceedingly complex analysis), a small group of objects chosen to be a system will exist as part of a larger local environment. The system as a whole then may interact with that environment. Consider the box of cereal above. Perhaps the box is torn, and cereal begins to spill. The physicist has a decision to make with regard to their system: continue to include every piece of cereal as part of the system (System A) or consider only the cereal inside the box to be part of the system (System B). See the figure\u0003below. Analyzing\u0003System\u0003A\u0003will\u0003be\u0003exceedingly\u0003complex,\u0003as\u0003 the small pieces of cereal move, bounce, accelerate, and collide with each other and the environment and scatter.\u0003Analyzing\u0003System\u0003B\u0003is\u0003much\u0003simpler:\u0003the\u0003box\u0003is\u0003 losing mass to the environment, but the box\u2013bag\u2013cereal system may be modeled as a single object that has a changing mass. Rigid System A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT CHANGE SHAPE, BUT DIFFERENT POINTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM MAY MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND WITH DIFFERENT SPEEDS. Suppose\u0003a\u0003wheel\u0003is\u0003supported\u0003by\u0003a\u0003horizontal\u0003axle,\u0003 so that the bottom of the wheel is not contacting the ground. While the wheel rotates, all points move together, and the shape of the wheel does not change. Points A and B are marked on the wheel, as shown in the following\u0003figure.

If the rotation of the wheel is relevant to the analysis of the situation, it cannot be modeled as an\u0003object\u0003because,\u0003by\u0003definition,\u0003the\u0003object\u0003model\u0003does\u0003 not\u0003account\u0003for\u0003these\u0003differences.\u0003Instead,\u0003the\u0003wheel\u0003is\u0003 modeled as a rigid system. For a rigid system, the location at which forces are exerted or the location of the point of analysis matters. Pushing\u0003on\u0003the\u0003top\u0003of\u0003the\u0003wheel\u0003will\u0003have\u0003a\u0003different\u0003 effect\u0003than\u0003pushing\u0003on\u0003the\u0003bottom\u0003of\u0003the\u0003wheel\u0003or\u0003 pushing directly toward the axle of the wheel. Again, the goals and complexity of the analysis dictates what model to use. Constant or conserved? The cereal example is a good place to discuss the subtlety between the terms constant and conserved, and how the choice of the system determines whether a quantity is constant or conserved. For the leaking cereal box, the total amount of cereal is conserved, in both System A and System B. In both choices of system, the total amount of cereal that exists does not change.\u0003However,\u0003the\u0003choice\u0003of\u0003system\u0003does\u0003influence\u0003 whether the amount of cereal within that system is constant.\u0003In\u0003the\u0003first\u0003choice,\u0003where\u0003the\u0003student\u0003decides\u0003 to continue to include each individual piece of cereal as part of the system, even as the cereal spills from the box, the total amount of cereal within the system is constant. In the second choice, where the student decides to only consider the cereal within the box as part of the system, the total amount of cereal within the system decreases, and is not constant. However, this\u0003cereal\u0003is\u0003still\u0003conserved\u2014the\u0003cereal\u0003does\u0003not\u0003 simply vanish, disappear, or cease to exist because it is not", "system is constant.

In the box\u2013Earth system, total mechanical energy is both conserved and constant. The total amount of energy within the system does not change as the box gains kinetic energy, and the gravitational potential energy of the box\u2013Earth system decreases. However, in a system consisting only of the box, the total amount of energy that system is not constant, but energy is conserved. The kinetic energy of the box increases, but this increase in energy is due to the transfer of energy into the box system by the external force of gravity doing work on the box. The energy transferred into the box by the force of gravity is not\u0003\u201cnew\u201d\u0003energy\u0003that\u0003was\u0003created\u0003by\u0003gravity\u2014the\u0003total\u0003 energy of the universe has remained the same and has been conserved.
